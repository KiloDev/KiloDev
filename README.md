- 👋 Hi, I’m Shayne!
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and desktop development, python, C#, C/C++ and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, python and Godot!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaberate on any Godot / C++ project to learn more about C++ and Godot Engine.
- 📫 How to reach me? Discord is my go to platform for communications! If you use Discord, here is my contact: Kilo#3512. Or email me at andromeda.kihi.developers@gmail.com
Just note that my response can be delayed by a week if I'm busy!
